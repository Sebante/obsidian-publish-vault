### Features:

- Price: 599k
- 56 ha
- 2 big houses
- Multiple other small structures on the land
- A huge ruin - See *"Meeting with Current Land Owner"* notes below
- 2km river frontage
- In the Saia district, which is apparently friendly to foreigners and projects*
- Within a REN zone, which as far as I understand means:
	- REN clears the land every 5 years*
	- Harder requirements on getting additional building permits
	- There's a 25 year project across the land and surrounding area's to destroy eucalyptus, with new native trees being planted that we could get to choose ourselves for our own land.

### Meeting with the current Land Owner

I met with the current land owner Gregory, and he told me:

- Another huge ruin exists on the land. 
	- Previously in 2016 Gregory took some plans for a 30 bed accommodation for this ruin and it *supposedly* got good feedback. Then the 2017 fires came and the plans did not go ahead. The ruin is pre 1951.
- Gregory and his sons apparently have good relationships with the local camara. Apparently it is possible to build extra buildings depending on the purpose and who you know.  If it is for working or maintaining the land or for the workers, it can be allowed to build.

*Taking all the comments from Gregory with a pinch of salt as I haven't verified this info myself yet.*
