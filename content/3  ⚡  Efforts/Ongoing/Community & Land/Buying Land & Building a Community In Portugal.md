*This document is a **request for collaboration** for **buying land and building a community** together in Portugal.*

*It is **not** a full specification or project plan.*

---
## Background

I'm looking to buy land with other investors, for the purpose of building a robust "home base" in the countryside of Portugal, with elements of community and private wilderness living.

I would like to divide the total plot privately between us, with a mixture of shared land and private land, my own having at least a home, or a pathway to constructing one.

The land should have good access to water, ideally bordering a river, and be private enough from neighbours and other traffic.

Smart redundant infrastructure can be planned and shared together, to maximise resources, time and energy.

Fun dreamy infrastructure can be suggested after our basic needs have been met. A community gym & spa comes to mind personally :)

---

## Purpose

Living in a van and travelling as a nomad, I would like to have somewhere to *return* to. A place I can call home, where friends and relatives can gather and work together towards shared community goals.

Even when I return back "home" to the UK, I struggle to meet friends and family, as we have all spread out further and further over time. The latest news from my oldest cousin, is a consideration of moving his whole family to New Zealand.

This effort is an attempt to collaborate on building both the **physical** and **relational** requirements for a community to emerge and grow from.

This is not just about buying land and a house together.

It is about building a strong foundation for a community, which could stretch generations if nurtured and guided with love and thoughtful intention.

## Personal Commitment

- I am organising and leading the initial effort, until a core group with the required skills has been established. At which point, further roles and responsibilities can be distributed amongst the group.

- I'm willing to pay up to ~200k euro's for my share. This is flexible depending on the specific land and requirements met.
  
- I'm committing to growing my network so that new potential community members can be found.

## Land Opportunity:

- [Quinta da Ribeira, 599k, 56 hectares](/3--⚡--Efforts/Ongoing/Community-&-Land/Quinta-da-Ribeira,-599k,-56-hectares)

Although this land ticks many boxes for me, I have my doubts as it sits almost entirely within a REN zone, so research is needed to find out what the exact restrictions are and how we might find ways around them.

### Things for Anyone Interested to Reflect on:

- Why do I want community & land? What do I hope for?
- What are my own terms? What are my needs and boundaries?
- What commitments and responsibilities could I offer? What do I have experience in? What do I enjoy or do naturally?
- How much can I invest? What yearly costs could I accept?
- What's my timeline for being ready to make a commitment?

---
## Invitation
