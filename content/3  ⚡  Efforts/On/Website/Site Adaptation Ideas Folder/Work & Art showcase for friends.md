1. Similar to [Friends Project Notice Board](/3--⚡--Efforts/On/Website/Site-Adaptation-Ideas-Folder/Friends-Project-Notice-Board), but less about a specific project and more a general showcase of any work and art
2. Display your work & art in your own showcase area for a closed group of friends to see what you're up to
3. Invite-only show cases: You choose who gets to see and comment on your work
4. Could be used for initial feedback or seeking collaboration towards an effort, before sharing with a wider audience. Or for brainstorming with friends where the work/art could go next
