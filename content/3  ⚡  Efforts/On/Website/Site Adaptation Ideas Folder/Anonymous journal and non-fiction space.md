1. Post anonymous journals or non-fictional writings and invite strangers to reply
2. Share deep reflections in an anonymous space
3. Focus on viewing into others' worlds without knowing who you're viewing or if it is even real
4. Mix up real reflections with fake ones, have people guessing if it's a truth or lie
5. Optional: Guess if it's truth or a lie, or guess the identity of the person. After some time, the OP must reveal either!
