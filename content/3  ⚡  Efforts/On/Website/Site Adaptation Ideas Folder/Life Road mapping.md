1. Life can be confusing, many decisions, much pressure - how about a place for friends to lay bare their ideas and options for what to do next in their life?
   
2. Create multiple "life roadmaps" for you and your friends to view, comment and make suggestions on
   
3. A visual diagram to *see* pathways, how they split or converge together
   
4. Attach introspective journals on your thoughts towards these life paths. Why they interest you and what you may be finding challenging.
		1. Receive reflections from friends (publicly or privately), providing support, encouragement or new suggestions
