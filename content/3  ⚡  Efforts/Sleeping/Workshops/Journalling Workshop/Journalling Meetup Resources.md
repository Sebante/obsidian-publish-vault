#### Reflective Journalling Guide:

'Reflective' journalling is useful for helping to gain clarity and understanding as well as processing emotions and events.

Below are some guidelines based on my personal experience, which I have checked against different sources of official journalling resources.

Please only use the below as a guide, and ultimately do what works for you. 

You'll only figure out what works well for you through trial and error. So don't be afraid to experiment!

___
##### When to do reflective journalling?

- When you feel confused or unsure
- When you want to gain clarity or understanding about something
- When you need to process an emotion or event
- As part of a routine to check in with yourself

___
##### How to start?

- Get straight to the point.
- State what you are unsure & uncertain about or would like clarity for.
- This often starts with a feeling. "I'm feeling unsure about... It could be because..."
    - If unsure on the specific emotion, focus on the body. Where do you feel it?
- Some Journalling prompts you can use to help you start:
    - What am I feeling right now, and why?
    - What‚Äôs been on my mind lately?
    - What decision am I facing, and what are the options?
    - What do I need right now?
    - What would I tell a friend in my situation?

___
##### How can you write?

- Write freely, not perfectly. Don't be afraid to jump around or explore multiple paths or opinions.
- Try to write with precision, intention, and be specific. Notice when your vocabulary is limited, and look up more descriptive words to help describe and express the situation.
- Follow your gut. Sometimes our minds can come up with logical reasons for things, but our gut knows the truth. It will twist when you try to convince yourself an untruth. Pay attention to this as you write and think and use it as a guide to show you what you are not seeing.
- Don't hold back, if you can. We all have things that are uncomfortable to face. But growth happens at the edge of our comfort, so go to that edge. Beware if you are feeling overwhelmed though, because overwhelm can create new problems. Take a step back and only approach highly triggering thoughts and memories as and when it's a good moment and you have the energy and capacity for that discomfort.
- Support yourself with compassion, like you would do with a child. Speak to yourself in a loving way when you feel fearful, anxious or discomfort.
- Don't force insight. Sometimes it's just venting. 
- If you come to a new understanding that feels important to remember, summarise it, revisit it and reflect on it again later. This stuff is great to create art with. Your journey tells a story!
- If you find yourself 'looping' on the same problem or indecision over a period of time, try:
    - Asking yourself new 'prompts', or questions on the topic.
    - Re-read old entries that you wrote on the same topic
    - Dialog journalling: split yourself into multiple parts which hold the various feelings and positions. Have them talk to each other, giving each part the space to fully communicate without interruption from the other equally valid parts.
    - Allow for stillness: Write that you don't know right now, and that's ok.
    - Reoccurring dreams: look for symbols and search online or with AI for their possible meanings. Don't blindly believe something you read if it doesn't feel true to you.
    - Reach out to a trusted friend, person or therapist. You can also try talking to AI, but please beware of the concerns and limitations of AI first.

#### Tech & resource recommendations:

- How We Feel App - For helping to figure out what emotions you are feeling
- AI for providing insight, breakdowns and suggestions. (Warnings: Data privacy, bias and hallucination concerns. Proceed with caution.)
- Obsidian App. Of all the journalling apps I've used, this is my favourite. It is most feature rich and privacy focused.
- Your Head is a Houseboat book (PDF) - A really great book for learning about how our minds work.
