Writing this after arriving in La Rochelle. 

The final blabla journey from Bordeaux to La Rochelle went really smoothly. I had a great conversation with the girl about our hopes and dreams in life. Also spoke about my reservations of soon being with family again. How it can be tough. The girl spoke about tough relationships she has in her family, but ultimately said that to her, family is her top priority in life.

Very happy to be here in La Rochelle. It feels both normal and strange to be here after such a long and unpredictable journey. 4 and a half chaotic days to get here. I'm quite impressed actually. If it wasn't for blabla cars then I honestly have no idea how I would have done it. Probably a very expensive car rental, I'm not sure that hitchhiking the entire journey with a dog would have been realistic.

Some conversations with my parents and Nan have me questioning how welcome I am here for the duration I have in mind. I thought I had already told them that it could be a couple of months, but everyone seems surprised I'm planning to stay that long. My parents are worried that I won't find it easy living with nan. That she is quite difficult and stuck in her ways. That she'll tell me off for doing things differently to how she likes them done. I think my nan is also concerned that I might expect her to cook or look after me. It might take her awhile to realise I'm here to help her.
