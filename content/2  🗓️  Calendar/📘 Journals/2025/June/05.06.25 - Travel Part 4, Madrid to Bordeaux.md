Starting my day want to follow my good routine of Waking Up theory and meditation.

Finding the Costs of Procrastination episode very relevant to yesterday's realisation of my own procrastination.

€68 for 2 tickets

In the blabla car to San Sebastian. Very happy this was not a scam. I didn't think it was, but I also learnt by now not to assume.

The driver seems quite stressed. I know he had to take a small detour to come and get me, but I am paying almost €70 for this trip. No, surely it can't be because of me. I think this man is likely stressed for other reasons. 

Anyway, we're hurtling down the motorway in this tiny car at speeds that give me confidence that I'll make my next blabla trip on time. If we make it in one piece that is. That's been a concern I've had lately with these blabla trips. My life is totally in the hands of strangers. All their funky driving habits. Whatever they have going on with them. I'm coming on board to that. Momentarily but significantly, seeing as we are often driving over 100kph most of the trip, so if anything unfortunate happened we'd be completely fucked.

Deciding I won't think about that, other than to try to sense if I think the driver is actually being totally reckless. If they are then I might ask them not to, but otherwise I will just trust them.

My next ride starts in San Sebastian at 4.30. If we don't stop driving then maps tells me we should arrive at 3.50. It's not a huge window, but hopefully enough. If we can't make it then I'll be stuck in San Sebastian tonight as there's no other trips showing.

If we do make it, then I think I'll be in a tactical position for the final leg up to La Rochelle. The place is on the smaller side though, so finding a cheap place to sleep could be the bigger challenge.

We stop for lunch. I didn't know we were stopping. I accept that I probably won't make my connection, and that's ok. I'm just happy to be getting to San Sebastian.

___

A message from the driver of my next connection, he says he needs more time. Perfect! It looks like I might make it to France today after all!

Today is going so smoothly so far! Completely opposite to yesterday! I made my connection to Bayonne with time to spare to walk and feed Stig. Amazing!

Now I've just managed to book a ride from Bayonne to Bordeaux! I can't believe it! I'm so close. Only 2 hours away from La Rochelle! Woohoo. I'm coming Nan! 🤞🏻

€57

Staying in an Airbnb in Bordeaux feels like the right decision. There was a ride to La Rochelle at 11.30pm, arriving at 1.30am, but that didn't feel very self loving. It would have been so uncomfortable to wait in the streets of Bordeaux for 4 hours with my bags and Stig only to then have to do the 2 hour drive and then trying to find my way to my nans in the middle of the night. 

The lady at this Airbnb is so lovely. She keeps talking as if her place is bad somehow, in reality it's the best Airbnb I've stayed at on the whole trip by a long shot, but still the same price.
