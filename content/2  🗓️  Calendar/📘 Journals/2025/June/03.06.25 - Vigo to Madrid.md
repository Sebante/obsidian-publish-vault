Problem with the blabla trip. The guy isn't coming to Vigo, even though the app says he is and I paid for that. I have to get a taxi to this guy, there's no other blabla cars going to Madrid today.

No Uber or bolt here. Only taxis. Taxi wants me to pay €38 to take me to the new blabla car pickup. It's only 23 minutes away. Ridiculous. Realising I don't have much other choices if I want to get to Madrid today.

Thinking now that if I spent a bit more time checking blabla and messaging people I could have made this easier.

Going to try to plan tomorrow's blabla ahead and try to have things go smoother.

In the blbla now. Driver and other passenger don't speak English, but my broken Portuguese is coming in clutch! Can't believe I have roughly A1 Portuguese and now Spanish it seems. It's night and day compared to not knowing anything!

The blabla car drives down past Vigo, just like I thought he would have to as he's driving to Madrid and I checked the route.

I asked him multiple times if he would drive down past Vigo, each time he said no he is not going that way. In the end he goes that way. Costs me €38 and delays our journey, the guy making it out as if I am late, when the app told me Vigo pickup and he actually did drive to Vigo in the end. How annoying.

Every bit of the journey is progress. Focusing on this fact as I consider that Stig may not be able to remain calm in the footwell for 6 more hours. He's trying to jump up on the seat every 10 minutes, groaning and constantly changing position. He isn't comfortable on the hard plastic in that cramped space as the car bumps around on the motorway.

Maybe we have to get dropped off somewhere if it's too bad. It's reassuring for me to just focus on making progress, not on the final outcome.

Driver driving recklessly. I suspect he has no idea he is even a dangerous driver. He's totally nonchalant about his high-speed swerving and slow response times to dangers. This guy is older than me. Makes me think about how age is not a reliable indicator of skill or capability.

Asked if we could stop so I could use my clothes from my bag to make a blanket so Stig can lay on the chair. The guy has agreed, now the journey looks much more doable!

Celebrating arriving in Madrid with Stig by buying us some chicken pastries. Eating them together out the same container felt like a nice reward and bonding moment after a long and difficult journey.

Getting dropped off on the wrong side of Madrid. The blabla app clearly shows me the guy is supposed to be going to the other side. He tells me he is not. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, but after he told me he wasn't going to Vigo, then drove right down past it, I find it hard. Either the app is making shit up or he fat fingered something or something else. I made a point to translate to him that these detours are costing me a lot of money in Ubers as I can't take the train/bus. He just told me it's the app's fault not him. Maybe he's right idk.

Sleeping in a small room in an apartment block on the outskirts of Madrid. It was the cheapest one available and I'm totally happy with it. I have everything I need. The lady was lovely and I get the feeling they really need the money. Happy I chose to come here.
