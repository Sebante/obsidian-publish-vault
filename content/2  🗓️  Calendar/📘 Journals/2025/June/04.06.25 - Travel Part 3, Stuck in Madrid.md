€28

So far today blabla is being a complete let down. The planned trip has been cancelled, people are trying to scam me and everyone is telling me they can't take dogs.

I took an Uber to the train station to give it another shot, but immediately was denied because of  Stig. The train stations here are like airports, you have to pass through a bloody security gate and bag scanners, so I can't see a way to sneak him on. The bus station told me the same. No dogs.

Definitely feeling the fear of the unknown. Fear of being trapped, fear of being stranded.

Thankfully realising that the issue isn't the lack of transport, the issue is me feeling scared and like there are no options. This mindset shuts my creativity and optimism down, which I need.

I decided to sit in the sun and enjoy my lunch with Stig. Reminding myself a bunch of things I am grateful for and how nice this sun feels on my skin.

Now heading to a nearby park that looks beautiful.

Really surprised at how hard it is to get a ride out of Madrid. I thought it'd be easy seeing as this is a capital city and there's so many people using blabla. Unfortunately half seem like scams and the other half tell me no dogs allowed.

Starting to wonder if I should consider renting a car. One more night in an Airbnb with Stig is at least €50. So far no one responded offering me a lift for tomorrow either, so it could be another stuck day. At that rate the car rental becomes better value.

Going to go and try to check out the car rental prices. I'm guessing they won't want Stig in the car though. 🙄

...

Over €400. Nope.

Waiting outside last night's Airbnb to be let in again. Failed to get out of Madrid today. Oh well. At least someone has confirmed my trip to San Sebastian for tomorrow. Really hoping that isn't a scam too.
