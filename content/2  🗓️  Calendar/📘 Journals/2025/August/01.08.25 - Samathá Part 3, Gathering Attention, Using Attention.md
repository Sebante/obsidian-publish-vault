Today was hard.

I kept falling into long day dreams or imaginations.

Feeling like part of my attention followed the breath while the other part of my attention was free to wander.

After some time doing this, and increasing frustration, I put a lot of energy into forcing all my attention to a single point. I'm not sure exactly how I did it, but it was like I tensed my mind and looked very hard into the darkness of my closed eyes. It seemed like the world, and my own thoughts, were being drowned out by the darkness I now intently focused on. A few times I felt myself reaching out to the edges of my awareness, the parts that were still hooking on to sounds and the beginnings of new thought streams, and pulling them in forcefully to the centre.

Realising that I had now created a ball of intense focus, similar to the day before but this time located somewhere in my visual field, I attempted to move it to my breath.

Within just a few heartbeats, my breath filled my awareness, as if summoned by my command.

My minds eye conjured up a greyscale visualisation of the scene. The air moving in and out of my respiratory system, with all the intricate details I had seen yesterday. I was right in there. I could see it all around me, I could feel it so clearly.

The ball of focus had been successfully moved without losing its intensity.

Feeling a sudden bolt of inspiration, I rushed up out of my seat, grabbing my spinning stick from leaning against the wall besides me.

Moving to stand at the edge of the grass where I felt it was safe to play, I got to work spinning my stick.

Knowing the ball of attention was still held together, I placed it on the movements of my hands and the whirling of the stick.

It was easy. Easier than normal. Time seemed to move slower.

I pushed myself to spin the stick to a near maximum velocity and held this speed comfortably.

I reversed to the other direction, almost in an instant. Swapping the spin direction easily and once again, pushing the stick to spin at a near maximum speed.

It was so fun, and exhilarating. Excitement seeped in as I twirled the stick almost effortlessly back and forth in my hands.

I started to imagine I was in some exhilarating performance. Feeling the eyes of some imaginary crowd resting on me. Leaving my body to view the spectacle for myself from a distance.

The sticks momentum began to outpace the movement of my hands. I knew then that it would likely only be a matter of time.

A few more ungraceful catches and rebalancing attempts before the stick flew out and cracked hard against the edge of the patio, rattling loudly and almost mockingly as it came to a halt, half on the grass half on the patio.

A stinging reminder that I was in fact alone, in my garden, with only the neighbours to hear the result of my seemingly childish play.

Shocked by the events that had just transpired. Realising for the first time after all these years of meditating, that once gathered, I can move and control this ball of attention towards a task. No longer just a simple exercise of quietening the mind, but learning to use it, to *harness* it, for greater effectiveness and heightened ability.

Knowing somewhere deep within me, that as playful and innocent as spinning a stick around may seem to anyone watching, from the perspective of using it as an extension of my Samathá practice, it was perhaps as noble and grand a pursuit as any I could ever conceive.


Distraction was the only reason I dropped the stick. Not my hands. Not my ability to see or pre-empt the movements of the wood, just very simply, maintaining the ball of attention in my mind, which had splintered, diverging off into egoistic fantasies and delusions. Leaving me with less awareness than necessary to maintain my speed.

Resolving that from now on I will include spinning my stick as part of my Buddhist Samathá training. Wanting to practice the gathering up this attention and then placing it on a task. Holding it there and resisting the urges to divert my attention elsewhere.

Wanting to see for myself, the extent at which my focus and attention can allow me to reach even faster and smoother spins and transitions.

For awhile now I felt that my maximum velocity had reached a plateau. Able to push it further only for a brief moment before losing control. 

Now I see the challenge more clearly. It is a mental battle, not a simple forced quickening of my hands. Greater focus is the answer for maintaining higher speeds comfortably.
