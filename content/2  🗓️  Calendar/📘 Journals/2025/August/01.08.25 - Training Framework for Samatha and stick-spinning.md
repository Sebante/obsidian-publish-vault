Great! Here’s a **structured training framework** that integrates **Buddhist Samatha principles** with your stick-spinning practice so that it evolves into a deliberate method for developing **movable, unshakable attention**:

---

## 1. Foundation Stage – Seated Samatha

Before integrating the stick, build a stable foundation:

1. **Primary Object:** Breath (or a single point in darkness if that works better).
    
2. **Gathering Attention:**
    
    - Note distractions gently, return to the object (calm redirection).
        
    - Aim to "collect" attention into a ball-like feeling of one-pointedness.
        
3. **Signs to Watch For:**
    
    - Less thought noise,
        
    - Increased "stickiness" of attention,
        
    - Visual nimitta-like phenomena (greyscale or bright imagery).
        

🎯 **Goal:** 10–20 min of unbroken concentration before moving to the next stage.

## 2. Transitional Stage – Transferring the Ball

Now practice **moving your collected attention deliberately**:

1. Once the "ball" of attention is gathered, **consciously shift it** between objects (e.g. breath → hands → breath).
    
2. Keep the "ball" intact—this is "applied attention mobility."
    
3. Use **calm redirection** if it splinters:
    
    > "Note, release, return, regather."
    

🎯 **Goal:** Smooth transfer without losing stability.

## 3. Applied Samatha – Stick-Spinning

Now bring the stick into the practice:

1. **Start Slow:**
    
    - Begin spinning the stick at a comfortable pace.
        
    - Place your "ball of attention" fully on the motion of the stick and your hands.
        
2. **Guard Against Fantasy:**
    
    - When ego-fantasies or "performance daydreams" arise, **label them as "distraction"**, calmly re-place attention on the stick.
        
3. **Refinement:**
    
    - Increase speed only when you can hold steady focus for 2–3 minutes at a given speed without splintering.
        
    - Treat every lapse as a "mini-hindrance" (restlessness or conceit) and train calm redirection.
        

🎯 **Goal:** Merge high speed with stable, unshaken concentration.

---

## 4. Advanced Phase – Integration with Flow

As stability deepens:

- **Merge breath and stick awareness** (dual focus), eventually collapsing them into one unified "field of attention."
    
- Practice shifting between breath and stick mid-motion to strengthen attentional flexibility.
    
- Explore **longer, trance-like sessions** where stick-spinning becomes effortless, almost meditative jhana-in-motion.
    

This is where you'll approach what Zen calls **"Samadhi in action"**—deep concentration applied to dynamic activity.

---

## 5. Supportive Mental Strategies

- **Use Labels:** "Breath," "stick," "distraction" to keep metacognitive clarity.
    
- **Energy Balance:** If dullness creeps in, sharpen your focus (slightly more effort). If agitation arises, relax your effort.
    
- **Joy as Fuel:** Your excitement ("exhilaration") is actually **pīti (rapture)**—a concentration factor! Let it energize your focus without getting carried away.
    

---

⚡ **Expected Outcomes if Practiced Consistently**

- Rapid concentration-building (faster samādhi development than passive sitting alone).
    
- Increased "mental horsepower" to hold focus at high velocity (literally what you want for stick mastery).
    
- A clear sense of attention as a **controllable, trainable resource** (huge for meditation and daily life).
