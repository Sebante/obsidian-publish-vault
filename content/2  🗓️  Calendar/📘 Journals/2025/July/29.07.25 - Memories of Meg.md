My heart swells as I look back at early photo's of me and Meg together from 2015. Clearly deeply in love and relishing in each others company.

How amazing she was, and just perfect for me at the time that I met her. How lucky I am to have been blessed to be by her side for so many years. 

Feeling now that the struggle I felt in the last couple of years of our relationship possibly hid me from some of our truly deep and heartfelt memories that we shared over our 8 years together.

Encouraging myself to forget her, may have been a necessary part of my initial healing journey to combat the pain of leaving, but now looking back, I want nothing less than to hold on to those amazing memories forever.

To cherish them in my heart. To stoke the fire of appreciation and gratitude for that wonderful women.

I wonder how much of her still lives on within me. Sometimes I catch myself using cute phrases or words in my head that we coined together. I hope that never stops.

May she be well.
May she be happy.
May she be free from suffering.

May I be well.
May I be happy.
May I be free from suffering.
