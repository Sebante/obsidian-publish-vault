~15 minutes meditation

---

The beginning was the hardest part. Thoughts of being unable to focus, feelings of being unworthy or even hopelessness appearing.

Recognising that this was just the sign that I was in the first minute or two of trying to train the mind.

For what felt like the first 5 to 8 minutes, my mind really resisted the focus point. I had to keep bringing my focus back to the breath, gently reminding myself to pay even closer attention at the end and start of each new cycle of the breath. Making sure to link the cycle fully.

This is where I most often lose my attention. Also gently pushing myself to pay even closer attention after noticing that I had lost focus. Focusing to notice every minute detail, every quiver or subtle tremble, that is otherwise completely unnoticeable in each breath. But it is there. The depth of detail exists if only I can pay close enough attention to notice. The breath is not one steady rhythm. It seems like it is, but looking closely I see the details. The rhythm of my breath is disturbed by my heart beat. It is disturbed by the way the air pushes and pulls through my system, getting caught and blocked by what I imagine is the rising and falling of air pressure in the various pockets that line my respiratory system. Perhaps the tiny movements of mucus and moisture in my lungs, throat and nose also create chaos within the shaky rhythm.

By the final 10 -15 minutes my mind is so focused on noticing each of these details, on each breath, breath after breath after breath, that it feels like I've entered a new state. A state of peace, calm, control, curiosity, confidence... wait, is this the "Self"? As described in the IFS framework? It seems to inhabit each of the 8 C's I think. I think it is. I've also described this state as my "mainframe" in previous journals. It's like the core, or centre of my being. It is whole, undamaged and knowing of the rest of the system. When I'm in my anxious mind, I can't get to the mainframe. But the mainframe has access to reach the part of me that gets anxious. It is aware of it's existence. It is not it, but it knows it. It could produce it, as a separate entity. A bit like running a virtual machine. The mainframe can sit outside of it, communicating with it, but the power dynamic is clearly directional.

Perhaps this is what is meant by the idea that the Self can help guide the wounded parts of our psyche system

The all seeing, all knowing, ever present, system admin of our bio-computing minds.

Wondering if as the system admin, I can set rules and permissions for each user of the system. Perhaps with the right configuration, I can control and restrict the users of my system from causing trouble. Trouble, like a broken if loop that repeatedly shows me warnings and threats even though one would have sufficed. Trouble like a broken cache registry, where known unhelpful and damaging patterns get used even though new habits and patterns would allow the system to run smoother.
