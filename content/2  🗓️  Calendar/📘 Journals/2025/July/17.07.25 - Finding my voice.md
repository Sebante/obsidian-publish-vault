After all this time at my nans, determined to find something in my writing that I supposedly didn't have already, it seems I have now found what I had all along.

Finally, this grasping at smoke can stop. I found peace by finding myself.

Here is my first reflection, my gift to the world, all I have to give and all I wish to give. Perfectly complete and incomplete at the same time.

If you would like to still view my previous attempts at writing in another style, then check out the below unfinished newsletters I drafted.

I'm not closed to there being a time and place for this style of writing, but it certainly comes with a substantial amount of time and effort, as well as an internal struggle of presenting things correctly while maintaining various writing frameworks. Possibly that is just the normal struggle of writing in a way where I am narrating a story for engagement, almost as a final memoir, as opposed to simply reflecting on something in the present moment, as it unfolds - as I have already been doing naturally for years.

Anyway, feedback of all sorts via a DM would be greatly appreciated for either styles of my writing.
