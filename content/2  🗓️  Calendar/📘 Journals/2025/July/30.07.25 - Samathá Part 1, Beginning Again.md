~22 minute meditation

---

At the start my attention would jump between sensations and sounds and I would have to keep forcing my attention back to the breath, once I noticed my attention had been stolen.

It was extremely frustrating, and even scary, to really face how little control I possessed over my own attention. I decided I would commit even harder to the practice, realising that it was the only way I would make some progress.

As I progressed, it became easier to will my attention to remain focused on the breath. Able to not lose focus at the end and beginning of each new breath, forming a perfect loop that I could keep my focus steady on.

At this point, it felt like the awareness of my breath was growing and becoming larger. Like it was gradually filling up my minds eye, getting closer to me, closer to the source of my consciousness awareness.

It felt like I was gathering up all my loose attention that had been floating about, into a single steady ball, forming at the centre.

I could hold this ball. I could feel it. I could direct it, I knew. It was mine to move and control. 

I opened my eyes and placed this ball of attention on Stig. I let my eyes rest easily, taking in his entire form without focusing on a single point. I could hold this steady focus comfortably, even as loud noises of cars exploded past in the background and as the wind swirled the branches of trees around us. I was not distracted. My attention was not broken.

Even now, as I am writing this. My focus and attention is strong. My mind comes to a point where I am focusing. Whereas before, my mind was like a cloud or even like tendrils. Reaching out to grab anything that moved. Now my mind does not reach out. It obeys my command.
