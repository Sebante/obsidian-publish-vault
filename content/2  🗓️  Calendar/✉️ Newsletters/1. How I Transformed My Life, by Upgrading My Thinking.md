## How I Transformed My Life, by Upgrading My Thinking
*A personal account series on how I made meaningful change*

---

**Everything in our lives is a result of thinking.**

Five years ago, I began practicing some specific *tools for thought* to help me bring about a transformation that felt long overdue.

Tools created out of *ancient wisdom*, *structured thinking* and *human science*, designed to help me become more aware and capable of dealing with *mindless* and *reactionary* based thinking that kept sending me down the wrong paths.

Paths that seemed completely logical and justified on paper, but ultimately led me to a deep feeling of *dissatisfaction* and *disconnection*.

Like the secure and high paying career (I was told) that I studied so hard to get, or the kind and loving partner of 8 years; both of which I couldn't help feeling somehow deeply *unaligned* with.

In the end, it was my own personal journey of self *discovery* and self *mastery* that ultimately led me to overcome these challenges and begin building a life that reflects more of who I really am. 

To my own quiet amazement, I now fund my lifestyle *entirely* through passive income, all while traveling across Portugal and beyond in a custom-built van, with an incredibly loyal rescue dog at my side.

What began as internal transformation, has now become a radically new way of living.

Each of these changes, *and the freedom they brought me*, came as a result of a handful of simple yet entirely profound methods that have invited deep meaning and purpose into my actions.

Helping me uncover what I truly wanted, understand it deeply, and most importantly, *follow through* on the small actions that could lead to transformation.

### The truth is: *I don't want to be average.*

I never have. Average wont help me realise my dreams. Average will not transform me from the immature child to the higher version of myself that I know exists beneath all the layers of unhealed traumas and bad habits. Average will likely never meet my soul mate, and if he did, he would never even know it.

To me, being average means to simply accept the way things are - without making it your life's purpose to uncover *who you really are*, what *lights you up* and what you're *capable of*.

Before you imagine an Olympic athlete or a chess grandmaster, let me say that I believe that the measure of a person's potential is inherently *ambiguous* and ultimately *subjective* to the person forging their own path.

It could be as simple as striving to earn a living doing the things you love; or as complex as deciding you want to extend the species to Mars.

Whatever it is, I believe that ordinary people are capable of achieving extraordinary things. BUT, **we need a way to get there**.

So, what helped me to uncover some of the potential that always existed within me - and more importantly, *how can you*? And what does that have to do with "upgrading" my thinking?

Enter: *Philosophy*, *Systems Thinking* and *Psychology*.

## You don’t *find* clarity — you *earn* it

Let's start with some ancient wisdom that get's to the heart of how we could begin to *earn* ourselves some clarity:

>*"The unexamined life is not worth living" - Socrates*

When I think back to the times I made decisions out of a *reaction* to fear, trying to "fit in", doing what's "right", avoiding discomfort by doing what feels "safe" - it becomes obvious to me (eventually), that I often do not *identify* with those actions. That's to say, the things I end up doing can feel *meaningless* to me, even if they feel deeply *meaningful* to somebody else.

**When I act in reaction to fear, my actions may be misaligned with my inner values - which leads to a disconnection from meaning.**

Before I could begin to get *practical* in changing this pattern, I had to face an invisible second order insight from Socrates wisdom, which I'll highlight by rephrasing the original quote:

>The **way** you examine your life, determines how worthwhile you'll find your life to be.

I needed to find a **way** to *effectively* and *consistently* understand what I *really thought* about *anything*. And so, I began to (clumsily) self-discover the practice of: **Reflective Journaling**.

### I don't *know* the answer, but I *trust* myself to discover it

Reflective Journaling is a *simple* yet *powerful* structured thinking technique, that great minds like *Leonardo da Vinci*, *Marcus Aurelius*, *Frida Kahlo* and *Marie Curie*, all used for the same goal of **sensemaking**.

From what I can find there isn't a single, universally accepted method for reflective journaling, although there are a few core principles:

1. *Observe*
2. *Capture*
3. *Distil*

I recently shared **my own** reflective journaling guide in a [journalling workshop](https://www.meetup.com/the-new-age-leadership-circle-lisbon/events/307914640/ "journalling workshop") that I hosted in one of the many beautiful parks in Lisbon. Here are my most useful tips:

### *When* to do it?

1. **Anytime** - As a "check in", using prompts like "What's been on my mind lately?".

2. **During strong emotions** - As a way to process them or understand where they've come from.

3. **During times of uncertainty** - As a way to figure out what you really think.

### *How* to do it?

1. Write freely, not perfectly. *(Observe & Capture)*

Don't perform. Write for yourself. Feel free to jump around and explore different versions of the truth. Try holding different opinions. If you don't like something, you don't even have to finish the senten

2. Listen to your gut. *(Observe & Capture)*

Our minds can come up with logical reasons for just about anything, but our gut knows the truth. It will *twist* when you try to convince yourself an untruth. Pay close attention to the body as you write and think. Use it as a guide to help show you the way.


3. . Summarise gold. *(Distil)*

When you uncover profound insight that feels important, summarise it *accurately* and *precisely*. Save it somewhere you can easily find again. This is excellent material to revisit and remind ourselves if we feel we may be repeating a pattern. We can even create affirmations or daily reminders around these to help us break hard habits - but I'll save more details about effective affirmations for a future article.

### The *Invitation*

Try the above method for yourself and see if it can help bring you more *clarity*, allowing you to make *meaningful* and *transformational* change, just as I did.

*I hope you enjoyed this first piece in the series of how I transformed my life.*

*Next I'll explore how meditation and Buddhism helped me build discipline and provide structure while forging a new path.*
