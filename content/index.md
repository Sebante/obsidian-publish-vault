**This space is an ongoing messy work in progress.**

It's a collection of personal notes linked together as a sort-of personal wiki. Documenting *my journey*, the *things I'm learning*, and someday, the *efforts* I'm seeking collaboration towards.

Notes are generally **non-linear**, so you can jump around and follow whatever path interests you. Some hyperlinks exist without pages behind them. These are area's I plan to get to in the future. Maybe.

I mostly tend to capture: *[reflections](/1--🌐--Atlas/Maps/Reflections)*, *[[concepts]]*, *[[quotes]]*, *[[ideas]]* and *[[efforts]]*. Click the links to follow the rabbit holes that interest you.

Recently I started writing a [newsletter](/1--🌐--Atlas/Maps/Newsletters), that eventually I plan to share with a wider audience once I have a few more in the pipeline. It's still experimental so I expect I'll be switching up the style, pace and tone as I experiment.

Just like a garden, this space will grow and change over time. Just like my mind. Always shifting with the environment, seasons and those who come to visit. For now, I have no easy way to notify you of updates. So come back whenever to see what's changed.

I'm using the [ACE Folder Framework](/1--🌐--Atlas/Dots/Concepts/ACE-Folder-Framework) to categorise notes like this:

### 1. 🌐 Atlas
##### *Where knowledge is stored*

### 2. 🗓️ Calendar
##### *Moments in Time*

### 3. ⚡ Efforts (Coming soon)
##### *What I'm working on*
