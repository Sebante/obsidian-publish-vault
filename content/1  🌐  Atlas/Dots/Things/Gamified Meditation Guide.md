## Gamified Meditation Guide

---

*This levelling system isn‚Äôt meant to mirror traditional Buddhist frameworks. It's just meant for fun and light guidance towards deeper practice.*

---

### Level 1

**Follow 10 full breaths, without losing focus.**

Count "one" softly on the inhale and "one" softly on the exhale. Increment to 10 and start again if your mind becomes distracted at any point, even for a brief moment.

Tips:
- Fill your entire attention with every miniscule and nuanced detail of the breath. Distraction is much harder when there isn't room for anything else.
- Let go of frustration quickly when you catch your mind wandering. Surrender with ease, and start the process again feeling "empty". Your mind will gradually soften and deep focus on the task will emerge.


---
### Level 2

Remain fully aware of your breath, while also being fully aware of any sounds you hear for ~5 minutes, without losing focus.

Tips:
- Best practiced directly after completing level 1 a few times in a row.
- Ensure your mind and body remains completely relaxed. Any form of "gripping", "tensing" or "forceful" effort, will work against you. Surrender to the process just like at level 1, and do it with **ease**, not effort.

---

### Level 3

Be fully present of all five senses for ~10 minutes, while moving through the world, performing tasks and interacting with people; without becoming distracted by thoughts or losing connection with your senses.

The above feels akin to being in [[Flow]] state.

Tips:
- Try to arrive in this state immediately.
- Live in your senses. Live in the moment. Remove all barriers between you and the world.

### Cheat code to *semi-experiencing* level 3

*Imagine you are walking through a dark forest at night, alone. You hear the snapping of a stick somewhere in the middle distance. You sense something dangerous is near, watching. Waiting.*

Welcome to your **survival state**.

You become **hyper-aware of your surroundings**: sounds are sharper, peripheral vision improves, time may feel slower.

Blood is redirected to muscles and away from *non-essential* functions like **rational deliberation**.

This is **not** flow state, but it is similar in some ways:

| Flow State                 | Survival State             |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| High focus                 | Hyperfocus on environment  |
| Loss of self-consciousness | Loss of reflective thought |
| Altered sense of time      | Time slows during fear     |
| Automatic, fluid action    | Reflexive, fast response   |
| Reward-driven              | Survival-driven            |
