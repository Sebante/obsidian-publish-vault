In [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/ "Obsidian"), a **note** is simply a Markdown (`.md`) file that serves as a unit of knowledge or thought. 

Each note can contain plain text, formatting (via Markdown syntax), links to other notes, embedded files (like images, PDFs, or audio), and metadata (via frontmatter or inline tags). 

Notes are stored locally in your "vault" (a folder of Markdown files), and Obsidian‚Äôs strength comes from connecting them together through links and a graph view, turning a collection of notes into a personal knowledge network.
