A *Mind Garden* is a personal, evolving digital space where ideas, notes, and knowledge are cultivated over time rather than published as fixed, finished pieces.

Unlike a traditional blog, which emphasizes polished and chronological posts, a mind garden is more like a living knowledge base - a network of interconnected notes that grow, change, and improve as you revisit and refine them.

### Key characteristics of a Mind Garden:

- 🌱 **Living, not static:** Content is updated and expanded as your thinking evolves.

- 🔗 **Interconnected:** Notes are linked together to form a web of related ideas.

- 🛠 **Work-in-progress:** Embraces unfinished thoughts, drafts, and ongoing experiments.

- 🌳 **Personal knowledge management:** Focuses on learning, exploration, and reflection rather than just presentation.

- 👀 **Public but informal:** Often shared openly, inviting others to explore or contribute without requiring it to be "perfect."

Essentially, it’s a space where you "grow" your ideas in public — like tending a garden — rather than simply publishing finished work.
