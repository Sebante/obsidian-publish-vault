ACE is the most universal folder system to help you to learn, remember, and create.

 > 
 > \[!Map\]+ ACE stands for:
 > 
 > * Atlas: The **space** of assets and knowledge
 > * Calendar: Moments in **time**, like meeting notes, thoughts and ideas
 > * Efforts: For our actions of **importance**.

It's more than just a folder system. It relates to the **head spaces** that we orient our thoughts around. The table below will help provide perspective.

|Headspace|Orienting Lens|Intention|Organizing Principle|Underlying Benefit|Guiding Question|
