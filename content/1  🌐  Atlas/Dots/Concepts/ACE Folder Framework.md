ACE is the most universal folder system to help you to learn, remember, and create.

> [!Map]+ ACE stands for: 
> - Atlas: The **space** of assets and knowledge
> - Calendar: Moments in **time**, like meeting notes, thoughts and ideas
> - Efforts: For our actions of **importance**.


It's more than just a folder system. It relates to the **head spaces** that we orient our thoughts around. The table below will help provide perspective.
