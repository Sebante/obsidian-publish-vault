*The path to Enlightenment and the cessation of suffering.*

___

The Eightfold Path is the fourth truth of the Four Noble Truths.

It can be divided into three main categories: Wisdom, Ethical Conduct and Mental Discipline.

___

## Factors of the Eightfold Path

### 1. Right View (Wisdom)

- A deep understanding of the Four Noble Truths
- The ability to distinguish wholesome roots Vs unwholesome roots of thought
- Recognising our own perception as a reflection of ourselves, not as an absolute truth of reality.
    - E.g if 10 people look at the same situation, there would be 10 different opinions and perspectives that form. Even if they overlap, there would be differences born from past memories and individual personalities.

- Looking into our own perceptions to identify afflictions of craving.
    - Often our perspective of what makes us happy is the very thing keeping us from being happy.
